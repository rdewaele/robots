Khepera III Toolbox:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Khepera_III_Toolbox
Description from the main page:
  The Khepera III Toolbox is a collection of scripts, programs and code modules
  for the Khepera III robot. The toolbox was developed by the Distributed
  Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (DISAL) at EPFL
  (Lausanne, Switzerland) and comprises:
  - Scripts to conveniently upload and run programs on multiple robots.
  - Programs to interact with most robot features
    (e.g. infrared sensors, motors).
  - A development environment (using arm-linux-gcc and make) to easily program
    and compile programs for the robot.
  - A very straightforward API to access sensors and actuators on the robot.
  - Install scripts to set up WLAN networking and other things.
  The toolbox does not need the libkorebot and provides a faster, safer and
  easier to use implementation of the same functionality.
