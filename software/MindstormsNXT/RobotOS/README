This folder contains ROS Fuerte workspaces.
To enter ('activate') a specific workspace, one can run its corresponding shell
script: enter_workspace.sh <workspace folder name>.
The workspaces have been initialized with rosws.

For more information about ROS workspaces / overlays, and more specifically for
the Fuerte release, please see
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Overlays

For the installation of ROS itself, please refer to their guide for ubuntu:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu
The platform on which the workspaces in this folder are developed and
maintained is currently Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (Precise Pangolin). The author's
intention is to keep the main development platform aligned to the ubuntu LTS
releases (normally every two years).
